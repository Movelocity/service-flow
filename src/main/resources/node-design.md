# Workflow Node Design Documentation

## Overview
The workflow system consists of four types of nodes that serve different purposes in the workflow execution. Each node type has specific properties and behaviors that define how it interacts with other nodes and affects the workflow execution.

## Node Types

### 1. START Node
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the workflow
- **Key Properties**:
  - `outputs`: Defines global variables and initial workflow state
  - Cannot be deleted (protected in UI)
  - No input connections allowed
  - Only output connections with 'default' condition
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Managed by `StartNodeEditor` component
  - Can define global variables for the entire workflow
  - Acts as the workflow initialization point

### 2. FUNCTION Node
- **Purpose**: Executes specific business logic or operations
- **Key Properties**:
  - `toolName`: Name of the function to execute
  - `toolDescription`: Description of the function's purpose
  - `inputs`: Map of input variable definitions
  - `outputs`: Map of output variable definitions
  - Both input and output connections allowed
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Managed by `FunctionNodeEditor` component
  - Supports binding to specific tools/functions
  - Can process input variables and produce output variables

### 3. CONDITION Node
- **Purpose**: Controls workflow branching based on conditions
- **Key Properties**:
  - Condition expression based on variables
  - Two possible output paths: 'true' and 'false'
  - Can reference input variables for comparison
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Managed by `ConditionNodeEditor` and `ConditionBuilder` components
  - Supports various comparison operators based on variable types:
    - String: contains, notContains, startsWith, endsWith, equals, notEquals, isEmpty, isNotEmpty
    - Number: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, isEmpty, isNotEmpty
    - Boolean: true, false
  - **Areas for Improvement**:
    - Complex condition combinations (AND/OR operations)
    - Support for more data types
    - Custom expression evaluation

### 4. END Node
- **Purpose**: Terminates a workflow branch
- **Key Properties**:
  - Only input connections allowed
  - No output connections
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Basic implementation with no special configuration
  - **Areas for Improvement**:
    - Define workflow output/result handling
    - Support for success/failure status
    - Final state data collection
    - Cleanup operations

## Common Node Properties
All nodes share these base properties:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `description`: Node description
- `type`: Node type (START/FUNCTION/CONDITION/END)
- `position`: Visual position in the workflow canvas
- `nextNodes`: Map of outgoing connections (key: condition, value: target node id)

## Connection System
- Nodes are connected through a directional graph system
- Connection types:
  - Default: Used by START and FUNCTION nodes
  - Conditional: Used by CONDITION nodes (true/false paths)
- Visual representation includes:
  - Color coding based on node type
  - Connection labels for condition paths
  - Interactive selection and deletion

## Areas for Enhancement

### 1. Condition Node
- Support for complex conditional logic
- Multiple condition branches
- Custom expression evaluation
- Variable type validation

### 2. Function Node
- Parameter validation
- Error handling
- Async operation support
- Function timeout handling

### 3. End Node
- Workflow result definition
- Success/failure status
- Output data structure
- Cleanup procedures

### 4. Start Node
- Input parameter validation
- Initial state validation
- Workflow parameter typing
- Default value handling

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Node state management is handled through Pinia store
- Visual representation uses Vue.js components
- Backend integration through Java services
- Workflow execution engine handles node traversal and execution
